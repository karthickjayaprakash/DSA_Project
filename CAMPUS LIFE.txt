CAMPUS LIFE:

Every attempt has been done by the management and other administrative boards to assure
 that every student finds SEEDLING a very lively, fun and resourceful community to employ their erudite years.
 Conscious of the influence these active years can have on the minds of the expectation of our nation and the globe,
 SEEDLING endeavours to promote, introduce and expand any and all ventures to shape their minds.
 By bringing clubs, chapters and college festivals,
 students are not simply revealed to a competitive environment inside the school but also with reputed schools  in and around the country.


WE CARE FOR YOUR CHILDS HEALTH. 
           
       we provide good and healthy food in our school mess.
